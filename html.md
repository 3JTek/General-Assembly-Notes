# HTML

### What is HTML?

HTML stands for:

**H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage

HTML is not a programming language, since it cannot perform any computation. It is simply text, which can be interpreted by a web browser, so that the data can be rendered on the screen.

It was created in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee as a way to share academic papers across the internet. 

#### Semantics

HTML was created as a way for the web browser, and search engines, to infer meaning about the contents of a web page. The various bits of content on the page are wrapped in **tags**. Each tag has a specific meaning. Tabular data is wrapped in `table` tags, paragraphs wrapped in `p` tags, and so on.

The important thing to remember is that **HTML is about semantics, not about layout.** Layout and styling is taken care of by a different language: CSS.

### Rules

All HTML files must conform to the following rules:

1. They must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration indicating which version of HTML the file should be interpreted as.
2. They must contain a `<head>` section and a `<body>` section.
