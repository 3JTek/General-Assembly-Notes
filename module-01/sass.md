# SASS

SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets. It is a pre-processor for CSS.

CSS can be a little difficult to work with mainly because of all the selectors we have to write out. SASS attempts to make CSS easier to work with by allowing us to:

* nest selectors
* create functions
* split our styles into smaller files
* write less CSS

## How does it work?

Web browsers cannot read SASS files, they can only read CSS files. We write SASS then we run a command in the terminal that will convert the SASS to a CSS file, so that a browser can interpret it. This is called _compiling_: converting code from one language (SASS) to another (CSS).

## SASS vs SCSS

There are two different syntaxes for writing SASS. The original SASS looks like this:

```sass
  nav
    ul
      margin: 0
      padding: 0
      list-style: none

    li
      display: inline-block

    a
      display: block
      padding: 6px 12px
      text-decoration: none
```

The alternative to SASS is SCSS (Sassy CSS), and it looks like this:

```scss
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

As you can see they are almost identical. **On this course we'll be using SCSS.**

## SASS Features

### Nesting

With SASS we can nest selectors, which means we can write less code:

```scss
footer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #fff;
  padding: 1em 0;
  p {
    color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    a { color: #c69; }
  }
  .date { color: #036; }
  ul.social_buttons {
    li {
      a.twitter { color: blue; }
      a.fb { color: green; }
      a.gplus { color: red; }
    }
  }
}
```

When converted to CSS, the above SCSS would look like this:

```css
footer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #fff;
  padding: 1em 0;
}

footer p { color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); }

footer p a { color: #c69; }

footer .date { color: #036; }

footer ul.social_buttons li a.twitter { color: blue; }

footer ul.social_buttons li a.fb { color: green; }

footer ul.social_buttons li a.gplus { color: red; }
```

### Using `&`

You can also use `&` when nesting to represent the parent selector:

```scss
a {
  &.twitter { color: blue; }
  &.fb { color: green; }
  &.gplus { color: red; }
}
```

The example would be equivalent to:

```scss
a.twitter { color: blue; }
a.fb { color: green; }
a.gplus { color: red; }
```

##Â Variables

Often it can be annoying when working with CSS that you have to remember HEX codes for various colours on a site. With SCSS, we can store property values in variables to reduce mistakes:

```scss
$body-background-color: #f5f5f5;
$text-color: #ccc;
$title-font: "Futura Bold", sans-serif;

body {
  background: $body-background-color;

  h1,h2 {
    font-family: $title-font;
    color: $text-color;
  }
}
```

## Modifying colours

Often we want to lighten or darken the background colour of a button or element on hover. With SCSS we can use the `lighten` and `darken` methods to calculate a new colour based on our original one:

```scss
$brand-color: #6f8;

button {
  background-color: $brand-color;
  &:hover {
    background-color: darken($brand-color, 20%);
  }
}
```

## Compiling SASS/SCSS

The simplest way to compile our SCSS files is by using the `sass` command-line tool. It's a ruby package, so we need to install it with ruby:

```sh
gem install sass
```

Once installed we can use the following command to transpile our SCSS:

```sh
sass path/to/source:path/to/dest
```

If our SCSS file was in `scss/style.scss` and we wanted to transpile it to `css/style.css` the command would look like this:

```sh
sass scss/style.scss:css/style.css
```

We can also watch for changes in our SCSS file with the `--watch` option. This way, when we update the SCSS file, it will automatically be converted to CSS on the fly.

```sh
sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
```
