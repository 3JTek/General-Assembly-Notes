# Decorators

Decorators are a way to add extra functionality to an existing function in Python. You can identify a decorator, because it is prefixed with an `@` symbol.

## Use cases

Before we look at how to create decorators, let's look at some _in the wild_.

Logging extra information from a function:

```py
@debug
def my_buggy_function():
  # code logic here...
```

Here `@debug` is a decorator, it will add detailed logs to `my_buggy_function`.

```py
@app.route('/cars', methods=["POST"])
@authenticated_user
def create_car():
  # code logic here...
```

In this example there are two decorators. `@app.route` Is decorating the function so that it is only called if the request matches the URL and method given. `@authenticated_user` would check that a logged in user is attempting to make the request.

## Passing functions by reference

In order to understand how to create decorators, it's important to understand that functions can be passed to other functions _by reference_, eg: as arguments.

Actually this should be a fairly simple concept for anyone coming from JavaScript, because JavaScript works in exactly the same way. In JavaScript we can pass a function to another function as an argument. In JavaScript, we call this a _callback_.

Let's look at an example:

```py
def hello(name):
  return f'Hi there, {name}'

def emphatic_hello(name):
  return f'{name.upper()}! How the devil are you!'

def greet_sabrina(callback):
  return callback('Sabrina')

greet_sabrina(hello) # Hi there, Sabrina
greet_sabrina(emphatic_hello) # SABRINA! How the devil are you!
```

As you can see `greet_sabrina` will call whichever function is passed to it. It will then call that function back, passing in the name Sabrina. So in the example above `hello`, and `emphatic_hello` are both callback functions.

## Returning functions from functions

Because functions can be passed around like variables, this means we can also return functions from functions. Here's an example:

```py
def weight_converter(unit):
  def lbs_to_kgs(amount):
    return amount * 0.453592

  def kgs_to_lbs(amount):
    return amount * 2.20462

  if unit == 'lbs':
    return lbs_to_kgs
  else:
    return kgs_to_lbs


converter = weight_converter('lbs')

converter(18) # 8.164656
```

In the example above the `weight_converter` function will return either the `lbs_to_kgs` function or the `kgs_to_lbs` function depending on the argument passed. The returned function is then stored in the `converter` variable, in this case `lbs_to_kgs`.

## A simple decorator

Let now actually make a decorator. Decorators can be made to do anything, that normally means adding some logic to an existing function. We'll make a decorator which calls a function twice:

```py
def do_twice(func):
  def wrapper():
    func()
    func()

  return wrapper
```

Here we have made a function `do_twice` which takes a callback. It then returns a function called `wrapper`, which when called, will run the callback function twice.

Here's how we could use it:

```py
def say_whee():
  print('Whee!')

say_whee = do_twice(say_whee)

say_whee()
# Whee!
# Whee!
```

So we have decorated our `say_whee` function with the `do_twice` decorator. Now its behaviour has changed.

Because this is a very common pattern in Python, there is a more elegant way of using a decorator. The example above can be re-written as follows:

```py
@do_twice
def say_whee():
  print('Whee!')

say_whee()
# Whee!
# Whee!
```

By prefixing the method with a `@` symbol, Python knows that we want to use it as a decorator. The function defined immediately below the decorator is upgraded with the decorator's functionality.

## Passing arguments

Let's look at a slightly more complex example, where we actually want to pass an argument to the decorated function:

```py
@do_twice
def say_hello(name):
  print(f'Hi there {name}')

say_hello('Isabelle')
```

Here we get an error.

```sh
TypeError: wrapper() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
```

This is because `do_twice` has returned the `wrapper` function we wrote inside, which is now being called when we call `say_hello`. We need to update our `do_twice` method like so:

```py
def do_twice(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    func(*args, **kwargs)
    func(*args, **kwargs)

  return wrapper
```

Here any arguments that are given to `wrapper` are immediately passed down to the original function.

> **Note**: `*args` will collect any positional arguments, and `**kwargs` will collect any keyword arguments.

Let's try that again:

```py
@do_twice
def say_hello(name):
  print(f'Hi there {name}')

say_hello('Isabelle')

# Hi Isabelle
# Hi Isabelle
```

## Wrapping up

One final thing: our decorated `say_hello` function is now actually the `wrapper` function from the `do_twice` decorator, which is not ideal. This might get confusing if we were to try to debug our code at a later date.

Let's ask `say_hello` what it's name is:

```py
@do_twice
def say_hello(name):
  print(f'Hi there {name}')

say_hello.__name__ # 'wrapper'
```

This is referring to the `wrapper` function inside the `do_twice` function.

To rectify this, we can use a special in-built Python decorator, designed specifically for this situation:

```py
from functools import wraps

def do_twice(func):
  @wraps(func) # use the wraps decorator from Python's functools module
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    func(*args, **kwargs)
    func(*args, **kwargs)

  return wrapper
```

With our new `do_twice` decorator in place, let's now check on the name of our `say_hello` function:

```py
@do_twice
def say_hello(name):
  print(f'Hi there {name}')

say_hello.__name__ # 'say_hello'
```

Perfect!
